First and foremost, the project has worked with images and metadata standards for images. The software developed include a catalog of openly licensed creative works, a browser plugin interacting with that catalog, and several libraries to support the managing of metadata for creative works. In total, this talk will skim across the following technologies and tools:\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Catalog - a free software backend for metadata storage, currently in production and seeded with metadata information about all openly licensed works from Wikimedia Commons, as well as other collections. The catalog API supports querying for images by URL or by a perceptual hash that will help you find images even if they've been resized.</li>\n<li>Blockhash - a JavaScript, Python and C library and utility to calculate basic perceptual hashes of images, with particular emphasis on verbatim reuse scenarios. This means that images that have been rescaled (sometimes heavily) or changed format, should result in identical or near-identical hashes, whereas images that have been modified to create derivative works should result in more different hashes.</li>\n<li>Elog.io - a Firefox and Chromium plugin that can query the Catalog for information about images to determine if they're openly licensed or not, and show you which images on a web page are openly licensed, as well as give you source links and a way to automatically attribute those images when you re-use them.</li>\n<li>hmsearch - A C++ implementation (with Node and Python interface) of hamming distance algorithm HmSearch using Kyoto Cabinet, used in the Catalog to search for hashes which are nearly identical.</li>\n<li>libgetmetadata - a library to retrieve metadata about images based on their URL</li>\n<li>libcredit - formats appropriate credit statements from an RDF graph with metadata</li>\n</ul>\n","start_time":"2015-01-31T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T11:50:00.000Z","track":"Miscellaneous","location":"Janson","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/automating_attribution/"},

We explore the idea and experiment with it on top of RPython (of\nPyPy fame) with its meta-tracing JIT compiler, as well as Truffle, the JVM\nframework of Oracle Labs for self-optimizing interpreters.\n\nIn this talk, we show how a simple interpreter can reach the same order of\nmagnitude of performance as the highly optimizing JVM for Java. We discuss the\nimplementation on top of RPython as well as on top of Java with Truffle so that\nyou can start right away, independent of whether you prefer the Python or JVM\necosystem.\n\nWhile our own experiments focus on SOM, a little Smalltalk variant to keep\nthings simple, other people have used this approach to improve peek performance\nof JRuby, or build languages such as JavaScript, R, and Python 3.","start_time":"2015-01-31T13:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T13:50:00.000Z","track":"Performance","location":"Janson","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/building_high_performance_language_implementations/"},

{"title":"lowRISC","subtitle":"The path to an open-source SoC","speakers":["Alex Bradbury"],"description":"There has been an explosion in interest in low-cost hardware platforms in recent years with many (e.g. Arduino and BeagleBone Black) having their schematics and PCB layout released under an open hardware license. These platforms are supported by open-source toolchains, applications, and libraries yet the processor this software targets remains closed. We believe there is an opportunity for open source processor and SoC designs to influence industry in a way similar to the successes we've seen in open source software - to help increase the pace of change of development, more easily move ideas from research to real world usage, and to lower the barrier of entry to the market.\n\nTwo features we are focusing on for our first test chip are <a href=\"http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/memo-2014-001-tagged-memory-and-minion-cores/\">tagged memory and 'minion' cores</a>. Tagged memory has applications in security, to prevent control-flow hijacking attacks or for debug or performance monitoring. The 'minions' we propose are small cores which also implement the RISC-V instruction set, used for implementation of I/O protocols in software, secure isolated execution, or many other potential uses.

{"title":"BERI","subtitle":"An open RISC softcore for research and experimentation","speakers":["Jonathan Woodruff"],"description":"BERI was created to facilitate experimentation at the boundaries between CPU architecture, operating systems, and programming languages.  It runs in Altera and Xilinx FPGAs, including the NetFPGA 10G board.  At 100MHz, it is fast enough to use as a real computer (albeit a fairly slow one).  This allows\n\nThere is a close tie between the history of UNIX-like systems and academic use.  The original AT&amp;T UNIX was distributed cheaply to universities and so formed the basis of both research projects and operating systems courses for a long time.  MINIX, originally free for non-commercial use and now BSD licensed, was written primarily as a platform for teaching and research use and the ties between BSD and UCB speak for themselves.  The open source community has benefitted enormously from people passing through university for almost three decades and studying UNIX and related systems.\n\nCompiler development has seen a similar renaissance in recent years, primarily spurred by LLVM, which provides a set of libraries that are easy to use and to modify for building compilers for new languages and new platforms.\n\nThe one missing part of the puzzle, so far, has been the hardware.  Although we have a plethora of commodity CPUs and even a number of open source designs, these have not typically well integrated into an open source stack.\n\nThis talk will discuss the BERI softcore, jointly developed by The University of Cambridge and SRI International and the associated open source software stack.  BERI, the Bluespec Extensible RISC Implementation, is a 64-bit MIPS implementation in Bluespec, a high-level hardware description language.  It implements the instruction set that debuted in the MIPS R4000 core in 1991, and therefore a set that is free of patents owing to its age.  In spite of this, it is a relatively modern 64-bit architecture and is well supported by open source systems.  The FreeBSD port to BERI required minimal changes, which were shipped as part of the FreeBSD 10.0 release, and runs unmodified userland 64-bit MIPS code.  BERI can run in simulation at a speed acceptable for testing but not for general usage or in an FPGA at 100MHz.  The BERI design supports multiple cores on a single FPGA and work is ongoing to support multicore across boards connected with a low-latency interconnect.\n\nOn top of this runs FreeBSD, a permissively licensed UNIX variant, and the LLVM compiler suite.  This provides a solid platform for experimental use, as users can modify any aspect of the system, from the instruction set upwards.  It is relatively simple, for example, to add a new set of instructions as a coprocessor to BERI, add code to the operating system so that the state is preserved across context switches, and add code generation support in LLVM.\n\nBERI provides a generic coprocessor interface, which makes it very easy to extend the functionality.  CHERI, Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions, is a BERI-based CPU that adds a coprocessor providing a capability-oriented memory model.  This demonstrates the extensibility of the BERI stack: the CPU, operating system, and compiler have all been modified to provide support for new functionality.","start_time":"2015-01-31T13:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T13:50:00.000Z","track":"Hardware","location":"K.1.105 (La Fontaine)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/beri/"},
{"title":"FreeCAD","subtitle":"a hackable design platform","speakers":["Yorik van Havre"],"description":"FreeCAD can be described as a big, modular \"collage\" between many heavyweight open-source libraries and projects, such as OpenCasCade (our geometry engine), Coin3D (an implementation of OpenInventor, which drives the 3D display), Qt and Python. But it can also, more accurately, be called a \"python beast\". With a bit of knowledge of the python language, its user is given the powers of a God.\n\nAlthough programmed mainly in C++, python is everywhere in FreeCAD: It acts as a \"glue\" between the \"core\" part of the application, which handles all the heavy geometric calculations, and the Qt graphical interface. This offers a wealth of interesting features such as the separation of FreeCAD into a non-GUI (server mode) part and a GUI part, possibilities to record, tweak, drive, or interact with the python flow in many ways, and much more. Each of the main libraries used in FreeCAD also has its own python bindings, all usable inside FreeCAD, all connecting to the running application and able to operate on its contents, its objects, its interface, its 3D display.\n\nPython code in FreeCAD is also constantly exposed to the user, turning the application very pedagogic. It is almost impossible to work with it without learning at least a bit of python. Many have tried.\n\nThis has formed a highly technically knowledgeable community around FreeCAD, where the differences between developer and user have blurred.\n\nThis talk will try to convey some of the amazing social/technical experience we have building this tool that is made to build.","start_time":"2015-01-31T14:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T14:50:00.000Z","track":"Hardware","location":"K.1.105 (La Fontaine)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/freecad/"},

While it has existed for tens of years already, it has always been been prohibitively expensive and a luxury that only rich corporations could afford.\n\nReadily available broadband, has opened up new horizons in the field however. The traditional video mixing servers (MCUs) are becoming irrelevant today and are being replaced by infinitely more scalable video routers, also known as Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs).\n\nGoogle Hangouts and the underlying Vidyo technology they used, have been one of the more popular examples in the past couple of years. Early 2014, jitsi.org also released Jitsi Videobridge, an open source video router (SFU) that is compatible with WebRTC and that allows FLOSS developers around the world to start building scalable video conferencing applications.\n\nThis lecture is going to go over some of the more important concepts of scalable video conferencing, such as selective routing, simulcasting and layered video, RTCP termination and others.\n\nWe are then going to look into the privacy issues related to video conferencing today, discuss the possibilities for truly confidential multi-party calls and the interesting impact, both positive and negative, that WebRTC has on the possible solutions.","start_time":"2015-01-31T14:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T14:15:00.000Z","track":"Lightning talks","location":"H.2215 (Ferrer)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/jitsi_videobridge/"},
{"title":"XMPP and Android","subtitle":"Creating stable, reliable, push-enabled and battery friendly XMPP connections on Android","speakers":["Florian Schmaus"],"description":"XMPP on Android is challenging. But with Smack there exists an open source XMPP client library written in Java, that is able to run natively on Java SE runtime environments and on Android. Smack is a lightweight, resource friendly and highly modular library. Ideal for the deployment in low-end devices. But the mobile usage scenario of Android devices poses another obstacle towards a stable and reliable (mobile) XMPP connection. Data connectivity changes, caused for example when a GSM ↔ WiFi switch happens, and high latency, are just some effects of such a mobile environment. With XEP-198 Stream Management, XMPP provides the ideal extension to tackle those issues. Using XEP-198 Stream Management enabled connections, data connectivity changes become transparent to the application.\n\nAnother obstacle imposed by Android is caused by the device entering the so called \"deep sleep\" mode. While incoming radio activity usually causes the device to leave the sleep, it's not guaranteed that it will not re-enter the sleep before the XMPP stanza has been fully processed. There are some forms of possible mitigations conceivable. But which are good? And which are just snake oil?\n\nI'll start with a short introduction of XMPP and Smack and explain how Smack is able to target Android and Java SE runtimes. The rest of the talk will consist of best practices using Smack on Android and how Smack can be used for stable, reliable XMPP connections and push notifications.","start_time":"2015-01-31T15:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T15:15:00.000Z","track":"Lightning talks","location":"H.2215 (Ferrer)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/xmpp_and_android/"},

XMPP and SIP tried to solve this, but haven't taken off as they might have done, leaving the internet dominated by closed proprietary islands of communication like WhatsApp, Facebook, Hangouts, etc.\n\nEnter Matrix: a set of pragmatic RESTful HTTP JSON APIs as an open standard, intended to be implemented on a wide range of servers, services and clients, letting developers build messaging and VoIP functionality on top of the Matrix ecosystem rather than adding yet another closed/proprietary solution.\n\nIn Matrix, every user runs one or more Matrix clients, which connect through to a Matrix \"homeserver\" which stores all their personal chat history and user account information - much as a mail client connects through to an IMAP/SMTP server. Just like email, you can either run your own Matrix homeserver, which means you own and control your own communications and history - or you can use one hosted by someone else (e.g. matrix.org) - there is no single point of control or mandatory service provider in Matrix.  In fact, there is no single point of control over conversations in Matrix at all - conversation history is a first class citizen, with room state replicated over all participating servers, avoiding single-points of failure or control as you get in XMPP MUCs.\n\nIn the end, we hope Matrix will crack the problem of a widely successful open federated platform for communication on the internet, and provide a worthy alternative to the PSTN. You should be able to use your favourite app to communicate via Matrix - and your recipients should be able to reply through the app of their choice!","start_time":"2015-01-31T15:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T15:15:00.000Z","track":"Lightning talks","location":"H.2215 (Ferrer)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/matrix/"},

In order to achieve this, we created a new approach for optimistic concurrency control, which was formally proven to be reliable and to output the best time complexity (compared to existing dedicated related literature). The approach was designed to support real-time shared editing on linear, tree and graph data structures. A short part of this lightning talk aims to present the core concepts of our approach.\n\nDesigned to work on both peer-to-peer and client-server architectures, Yjs can be easily embedded in Web applications in order to foster collaboration. Developed in Javascript, the framework outputs very good scaling capabilities in the number of users and operations in test environments. Yjs currently supports text, JSON and XML data types and was tested using WebRTC and XMPP as an underlying communication protocol.\n\nIn this lightning talk, the Yjs framework will be presented to the wider OS community for the first time. We consider our framework to be developer friendly, but given the opportunity of a lightning talk, we would like to invite FOSDEM developers to use Yjs and share with us their experience. Ideally we aim to establish connections and potential collaborations, in order to improve our open source project.","start_time":"2015-01-31T15:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T15:15:00.000Z","track":"Lightning talks","location":"H.2215 (Ferrer)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/yatta/"},

{"title":"Pretty-printing kernel data structures","subtitle":"Reusing D-Trace technology in unexpected places","speakers":["Daniel Lovasko"],"description":"In order to use the CTF technology a new implementation of the format had to be\ndeveloped - truly multiplatform, freely licensed and supporting different\nendians. The project had to tackle many difficult problems such as transport of\nthe CTF data to the kernel debugger, which itself is a very limited space.\nPretty-printing recursive data structures can be very tricky, as they are\nimplemented as nested struct pointers and the interpretation can lead into\nunmanageable indentation issues. The solution is to detect certain common types\nof data structures - lists, queues and trees - and adapt to such structures on\na higher level of abstraction.\n\nApart from the DDB application, CTF data can be used inside user-space\ndebuggers too. As a result of the slim binary design of the format storage,\neach binary in the whole system, even a production one, can contain the CTF\ndata. To achieve even further minimisation of the space used, a concept of\nmultilevel parent-child relationships was introduced, in which the parent\ncontains the types used in both parent and child and its own, whereas the child\nhas only its unique ones and references the parent set.\n\nThis talk is interesting outside of the BSD community too: since the libctf\nimplementation is multiplatform and supports the Debian and OpenIndiana\ndistributions, such pretty-printing functionality could be ported. The CTF\ntoolset - ctfconvert, ctfmerge and ctfdump - is multiplatform as well.  Thanks\nto the free BSD license, the inclusion of such library should not pose a legal\nproblem. Some parts of the project are still work in progress and therefore the\ncommunity support is much appreciated.","start_time":"2015-01-31T17:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T17:15:00.000Z","track":"Lightning talks","location":"H.2215 (Ferrer)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/dtrace/"},
{"title":"Moving your Virtual Machines to oVirt with ease","subtitle":"Overview of the process of import VMs from different environments into oVirt in light of the upcoming integration with virt-v2v","speakers":["Arik Hadas"],"description":"Until now from oVirt one could only import virtual machines (VMs) that were managed once by oVirt, either VMs that were exported from oVirt or VMs that reside on storage that was attached once to oVirt. In order to import VMs that run on different hypervisors or managed by different tools/management solutions, one had to use external tool, such as virt-v2v, separately to convert the VMs so they will fit to oVirt and then import the VMs from oVirt. This results in a slow, tedious and error-prone process.\nAn important feature in oVirt 3.6 is going to be the extension of import VMs capabilities to provide users with a process that is integrated within oVirt web-admin ui for import VMs from external environments, i.e VMs that run on different hypervisors and managed by different management solutions. We produce a process based on integration with virt-v2v, for import such VMs to oVirt which is better in terms of usability, performance and monitoring. The new process will ease migration of existing VMs into oVirt, encouraging people to have their existing virtual environments replaced with oVirt.\nIn this session we will analyse the problems with the previous process, go over the design of the new one and see how it address the problems we used to have, producing a better way for migrate existing virtual environments to open source virtualization platform.","start_time":"2015-01-31T09:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T09:20:00.000Z","track":"Infrastructure as a service","location":"UD2.120 (Chavanne)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/v2v/"},
{"title":"Build Distributed, Fault-Tolerant Infrastructure with Apache Mesos","subtitle":"","speakers":["Dave Lester"],"description":"Apache Mesos is a resource manager for datacenter infrastructure that uses a two-level scheduling model [1] to provide hardware resources to various application frameworks. Similar to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Mesos manages hardware and the execution of applications, while delegating the responsibility of deployment to other platforms. In the Mesos model, application frameworks are responsible for scheduling and deployment logic. Multiple frameworks can be run on bare-metal at the same time using a single pool of resources, including use-cases for long-running services (including Marathon, Aurora, Singularity), and batch/streaming (Hadoop, Storm, Jenkins).\n\nThe abstraction Mesos provides for running and writing distributed applications has proven interesting to several IaaS projects, including OpenStack [3] and CloudStack. [4] While IaaS typically addresses a larger set of concerns (including virtual machines, servers, storage, load balancers, and network), the narrow focus of Mesos on resource management has provided opportunities for integration between traditional IaaS and Mesos in the future.\n\nOrganized in two parts, this talk will provide both an overview of the Mesos compute model (comparing and contrasting how it relates to IaaS), and walk through writing an application for Mesos using the framework API.\n\nPart one will cover their essential architectures and how they enable fault-tolerance with replicated master nodes, scalability to 10,000's of machines, and resource isolation between tasks. Part two will demonstrate how users can write custom application schedulers for Mesos by leading through an example (likely in Python or Go). Attendees will come away with an understanding of how the software abstractions Mesos provides (resource manager and scheduler) work together, and with essential knowledge to write a custom scheduler.\n\nCitations:\n[1] http://people.csail.mit.edu/matei/papers/2011/nsdi_mesos.pdf\n[2] http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/mesos-frameworks\n[3] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-876\n[4] https://twitter.com/ke4qqq/status/535421157202460674","start_time":"2015-01-31T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T10:40:00.000Z","track":"Infrastructure as a service","location":"UD2.120 (Chavanne)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/faulttolerantmesos/"},

{"title":"What you can do with open source cloud management (and ManageIQ)","subtitle":"Control all of the things","speakers":["John Mark Walker"],"description":"What is \"Cloud Management\"? In a datacenter, you might have 2 or more virtualization management platforms, with a private cloud running alongside, and some workloads running in a public cloud. ManageIQ gives admins and developers a way to seamlessly deliver services from multiple cloud and virtualization platforms.\n\nAcross your cloud and virtualization platforms, you'll need to enforce some kind of consistency in who can consume your resources, integrate with approval workflows, and be aware of waste when it is happening. Maybe you also want to automate the provisioning of instances, integrate with a service catalog or configuration management system. Perhaps you want to know when VMs are vulnerable to security issues, prevent new VMs to be created from known-bad templates, and perform some clean-up of services when they are retired.\n\nThese are all cloud management problems. Whether it's containing VM sprawl or finding and fixing hot spots in the data center, this presentation will give you tools and techniques you can use to manage it all.\n\nManageIQ is a recently open sourced cloud management platform and toolkit with a RESTful API and comprehensive gateway to most popular virtualization and cloud services platforms, including vSphere, Hyper-V, oVirt, RHEV, AWS, and OpenStack (with more on the way). It is a powerful orchestration and automation engine that admins use to integrate their build, test and deploy services with virtualization and cloud platforms. ManageIQ allows developers and admins to manage their services in one place, side-by-side.\n\nIn this technical deep dive, we will explore the orchestration and automation components of ManageIQ and demonstrate how it can be used to operationalize any hybrid cloud deployment . You'll learn about:\n\n<pre><code>Code to create an application service catalog.\nAutomation of compute host evacuation in response to monitoring and security events\nPreparation of physical compute hosts in advance of planned maintenance work.\nThis talk will include an overview of the ManageIQ community as well as a live demonstration.\n</code></pre>","start_time":"2015-01-31T15:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T15:40:00.000Z","track":"Infrastructure as a service","location":"UD2.120 (Chavanne)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/whatmanageiq/"},

It allows modelling a broad range of random phenomenons, like dice throwing, coin tossing, cards hands, gambling, lottery, … with fair or unfair characteristics! More generally, Lea may be used for any finite set of discrete values having known probability: numbers, boolean variables, date/times, symbols, ...\n\nEach probability distribution is modelled as a plain object, which can be named, displayed, queried or processed to produce new distribution objects. Lea provides standard indicators, conditional probabilities and generation of random samples. The forthcoming Lea 2 (should be ready for FOSDEM 2015!) shall include Bayesian reasoning, Markov chains and \"Leash\", a high-level PPL (Probability Programming Language).\n\nOn an implementation point of view, probabilities are stored using integers (e.g. not float), allowing to avoid any risk of rounding errors.

And even as a corporation, GitHub has at times attempted to organize itself according to open source models, experimenting with non-coercive, collaborative, and geographically disparate structures of corporate organization.\n\nGitHub's internal legal counsel wishes to discuss what GitHub can do to help existing open source projects thrive, to support new projects and new contributors, and to promote the development of the open source community. More specifically, and given GitHub's unique vantage point, GitHub Legal is working on projects utilizing tools of governance and process to contribute to open source in new ways. We wish to present the details of an \"Open Source by Design\" project in four parts.\n\nThe first part relates to altering the default understanding as to what it means for a project to be hosted without an explicit license on GitHub. We show why we need to tread with care when we alter this default, which data we are collecting that is intended to help us choose the new default wisely, and where that data seems to lead.\n\nOur second part aims to help introduce governance infrastructure to open source projects in order to solve problems that such projects may some day face. We place particular focus on problems that, in GitHub's experience, often hamper open source projects as they transition along some relevant axis, be it user makeup, maintainer makeup, rate of adoption, commercial developments, design disputes, ownership disputes or the like. We believe that by developing and offering some measure of template governance structures, much confusion and many challenges that bedevil open source projects may be avoided.\n\nWe are sensitive to the potential side-effects of such a project, such as the stifling of alternate project organization and governance models. Another interesting aspect of study would be to what extent, if any, such bottom-up models of project self-governance would influence, supplement, or even act take on the role of law as they themselves became subject to things like increased adoption and standardization. This question seems particularly relevant in areas where formal legislative intervention is light.\n\nThe third part of an \"Open Source by Design\" project would be a new compliance service that aims to help projects comply with license requirements of third party code that they use, to avoid license inconsistencies where they actually occur and flags preventing the neglect of licensing.\n\nFinally, we've given much thought to the metrics by which we would gauge the success of the different steps of this project once implemented and that could help us plan the second stage of the project.","start_time":"2015-01-31T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T10:40:00.000Z","track":"Legal and policy issues","location":"H.1308 (Rolin)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/opensourcebydesign/"},

{"title":"Towards legal criteria for best practices in free software/open source development","subtitle":"","speakers":["Richard Fontana"],"description":"It was traditionally assumed that licensing of source code under a\nfree software/open source license, with its basic forkability\nguarantee, was sufficient for software to <em>be</em> free. More recently,\nsome have suggested that source code licensing criteria is\ninsufficient to capture what is truly normative in the development and\ngovernance of FLOSS projects, but no settled view on what constitutes\n\"open development\" or \"good FLOSS governance\" has yet emerged.\n\nWhile some ideas that have been suggested for defining so-called \"open\ndevelopment\" and good project governance focus on technical criteria,\nthis talk will discuss those that are essentially legal in nature, and\nthe policy justifications for their inclusion. At root these concern\nthe desire to maximize diverse participation on an egalitarian and\nauthentically meritocratic basis with a minimum of legal or other\nstructural impediments, and an avoidance of distorting or corrupting\ninfluence by relatively powerful or influential project participants\nor governance stakeholders.\n\nImportant examples of such legal criteria include distributed\ncopyright ownership coupled with symmetrical inbound/outbound\nlicensing, as well as community fairness in trademark policy\nformulation and the arguable need for external mechanisms of patent\nnonassertion for projects dominated by corporate contribution. I will\nalso argue that it is an essential legal feature of good governance\nfor projects or their affiliated foundations to affirmatively prevent\nor police abusive or exclusionary behavior by project participants.\nSome focus will be placed on problems presented by large-scale,\nwell-known projects that receive significant corporate participation.","start_time":"2015-01-31T15:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T15:40:00.000Z","track":"Legal and policy issues","location":"H.1308 (Rolin)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/legal_best_practices/"},

","subtitle":"","speakers":["Deb Nicholson"],"description":"The huge increase in software patent litigation over the last 15 years has produced reams of articles, cost fortunes and even snagged the US President's attention. But when something goes on for long enough, it also produces data -- lots and lots of data. So what have we learned from all the data?\n\nNon-practicing entities are growing and litigation costs increase each year, but that's hardly the whole story. Even as defensive strategies are proliferating, software patent plaintiffs are becoming much more sophisticated. Software patent trolls are expanding their reach internationally and practicing entities are increasingly embracing troll-like behavior. Ms. Nicholson will examine data from academic and industrial sources to see what it all means for Linux, Android, GNU and the rest of the free software community. More data provides more opportunities to defend free software from the pernicious effects of vague and overly broad software patent aggression, as long as we are willing to use it.","start_time":"2015-01-31T16:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T16:25:00.000Z","track":"Legal and policy issues","location":"H.1308 (Rolin)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/patents/"},

{"title":"Discrimination & Reciprocity","subtitle":"Termination Clauses in FOSS and FRAND Licenses","speakers":["Eli Greenbaum"],"description":"A fundamental principle of FOSS and FRAND licensing is that the rights under the license must be made available to all end users or willing licensees. The Open Source Definition, for example, expressly provides that open source licenses must not “restrict any party” from redistributing the licensed software, and that such licenses cannot “discriminate against any person or group of persons”. The principles of FRAND licenses are perhaps less sharply defined, but the “ND” in FRAND also imposes a similar requirement of “non-discrimination”.\n\nNotwithstanding these principles, many FOSS licenses provide that licensees that breach the terms of the license can have their rights terminated. FOSS and FRAND licenses may also include “defensive termination” provisions, which allow for the termination of rights in retaliation for patent infringement suits. Such provisions allow licensors to discriminate against specific and identifiable licensees by revoking previously granted rights. Typically, according to these provisions, once a licensee’s rights are terminated the licensor has no obligation to reinstate these rights. Even if the licensor does agree to reinstate the licensee’s rights, the licensor may discriminate against the licensee by imposing restrictions or obligations that would not be permitted under the original terms of the license.\n\nOne could imagine an alternative means of structuring FOSS and FRAND licenses that, in hewing more closely to standards of non-discrimination, would not include termination provisions. Licensors would perhaps be required to allow licensees to continue exercising their rights, even as the licensor brings suit against the licensee for copyright infringement or breach of the license. Licensors would not be allowed to impose additional obligations on a licensee in exchange for the reinstatement of license rights.\n\nThe talk will advance several explanations of why termination provisions are nonetheless a justified breach of the non-discrimination principles in FOSS and FRAND licenses. Such explanations will include a discussion of the basic principles of non-discrimination and reciprocity in FOSS licenses and FRAND commitments, an analysis of possible remedies available to licensors aside from termination, and an exploration of the legal risks to licensors and licensees of not including termination provisions in the license. The talk will also illustrate the tensions between termination provisions and non-discrimination principles by reference to a number of current debates.","start_time":"2015-01-31T17:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T17:35:00.000Z","track":"Legal and policy issues","location":"H.1308 (Rolin)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/termination/"},

Though examples are offered in the readable Puppet DSL, this talk is designed for anyone using configuration management software to manage infrastructure and applications. No knowledge of Puppet is required to learn from this session.\n\nRyan has been knee-deep in infrastructure code for 4 years, starting as a user of Puppet at Penn State and moving on to manage the Puppet Forge at Puppet Labs, a shared repository for great (and not so great) infrastructure as code written in the Puppet DSL. He’ll cover how to identify various quality characteristics and why they matter in your day to day. It’s not just about conforming to a style and aligning your braces!

What is it like to be downstream of one of these projects?","speakers":["Spencer Krum"],"description":"OpenStack's infrastructure team has an open source infrastructure primarily using the Puppet configuration management tool. Using hiera they are able to separate secrets from puppet code, and using roles they can keep OpenStack specific logic from generically reusable configuration. The infrastructure is multifaceted but the core of it is gerrit for code review, cgit for code checkout, zuul for merging/gating, jenkins and gearman for testing with apache, mysql, and zmq doing what they do best.\n\nMy team at HP consumes this open source infrastructure and replicates it internally. We use their Puppet code, and do the dance of the downstream: patch/submit patch upstream/reconsume patch after it has landed upstream. We call the project Gozer and our admins are called Ghostbusters. We attend the weekly meeting that upstream holds, and some of us are well on our way to having our upstream commit bits, but our core focus is on maintaining the downstream ci/cd pipeline for HP.\nConfiguration management is the reason any of this is possible. I'm going to talk about specific ways Puppet code can be written to be re-consumable, and highlight a couple 'dead ends' we walked down before finding some successful patterns.\n\nIn this presentation I will cover:\n\n<pre><code>The problems upstream is solving, the problems downstream is solving, where those goals align and where they differ\n\nHow we bootstrapped our infrastructure(and why that was a problem)\n\nHow we participate upstream\n\nHow the Puppet codebase has evolved to be more consumable, where it started, and where it is now\n\nHow we dealt with different network topology between our infrastructure and upstream's infrastructure\n\nHow we maintain parity with upstream (consistently consuming it)\n\nHow we consume data, not just code\n\nAnswer questions\n</code></pre>","start_time":"2015-01-31T16:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T17:00:00.000Z","track":"Configuration management","location":"H.1309 (Van Rijn)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/consuming_foss_configuration/"},

{"title":"Partial inlining of Memcheck helper function fast paths","subtitle":"","speakers":["Julian Seward"],"description":"Valgrind's Memcheck tool performs address checking at the byte level and definedness checking at the bit level.  Most of the definedness checking code is generated by Valgrind's JIT (VEX) as in-line code. But address checking is done by calling small C helper functions. That means one function call for each memory access to be checked, which is expensive.  And it's wasteful because those checks are actually very simple, so the overhead of the calls is significant.\n\nThis talk describes ongoing work to inline the fast paths of such helper functions into the generated code.  The fast paths deal with the common case -- naturally aligned addresses and fully defined values -- with all other cases being pushed \"off-trace\" onto cold paths, possibly with helper calls to C land.\n\nModifying the until-now simple JIT to support the arbitrary control flow this requires would be a big and complex task.  Instead we use a system of machine code templates which allow precise control of branching and register use without significantly complicating the JIT. Making the templates architecture-neutral yet capable of generating good straight-line code is an interesting challenge.","start_time":"2015-01-31T14:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T14:50:00.000Z","track":"Valgrind","location":"AW1.120","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/valgrind_inlining/"},

As we aim to do more, we stretch existing technologies far beyond what they were intended for. Remarkable efforts like <em>Apache Giraph</em> or the <em>Titan</em> project are examples that are pushing the bounds. Ultimately the brute force techniques are inefficient, often don't scale very well and come with their own problems. In the ideal world, a scalable graph processing system would evenly distribute both vertices and edges. Richard Karp has shown this to be an np-complete problem (i.e. the clique problem / complete subgraphs).\n\nThe talk will give a brief introduction to <em>CRDT - Convergent &amp; Commutative Replicated Data types</em> and how commutative &amp; idempotent operations enable the three contributions.\nThree key contributions The Tesseract makes include partitioning \"super vertices\" with a technique called \"<strong>cascading vertices</strong>\",  an optimization called \"<strong>wormhole traversal</strong>\" and a computational framework, \"<strong>TQL</strong>\" able to make use of two aforementioned techniques.

For example, companies may want to detect whenever they are mentioned in a news feed; or a Twitter user might want to see a continuous stream of tweets for a particular hashtag.\n\nLuwak provides a mechanism for running many thousands of queries over a single document in a highly efficient manner, by filtering out queries that it can detect will not match.  Luwak is designed to run on a single node, holding all registered queries in RAM.  Scaling to higher document throughput, or to more queries, requires parallelization across multiple machines.\n\nSamza provides a framework for such parallelization, by partitioning and recombining both the document streams and the query set (which can be treated as just another stream), and also provides fault-tolerance mechanisms that allows swift recovery from machine failure, without losing documents or queries.","start_time":"2015-01-31T13:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T13:45:00.000Z","track":"Open source search","location":"UA2.114 (Baudoux)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/searching_over_streams_with_luwak_and_apache_samza/"},

{"title":"The Typed Index","subtitle":"","speakers":["Christoph Goller"],"description":"If you want to search in a multilingual environment with high-quality language-specific word-normalization you soon realize, that you need different types of terms. For example you cannot use morphologically normalized terms or stemmed terms for every kind of search. For Wildcard- and Fuzzy-Search you need terms that have not been normalized at all or that have been normalized only slightly. Phonetic search adds another kind of normal form. Sometimes search should be case-sensitive (e.g. if you want to distinguish between search for the company \"MAN\" and the word \"man\") sometimes it shouldn´t. Semantic search (search for persons, organizations and places) might add another type of terms. Usually one uses different fields to distinguish between different types of terms. I will show that putting different types of terms into the same field and representing their type by e.g. a prefix, has an important advantages. It allows you to use the important information about their relative positions. I even challenge the standard approach of having different fields for different languages because it requires so much configuration effort and because it prevents a reasonable treatment of mixed-language documents. At IntraFind we decided to implement a language chunker based on Ted Dunnings paper \"Statistical Identification of Language\" and to include it into our next-generation linguistic analyzer for Lucene/Solr/Elasticsearch. It identifies chunks of the same language within text and delegates the analysis to a specified language-specific analyzer, which might be a high-quality IntraFind morphological analyzer, a third-party analyzer or one of the high-quality Lucene Open-Source analyzers e.g. for Chinese and Japanese. Terms of different languages are distinguished by different prefixes (types). In this way we can provide an easy-to-use and very powerful linguistic analyzer that requires almost no configuration effort. You simply index your content and don’t have to care about the language. If there is enough time I would like to add a deep dive into Lucene Analysis with position increments and position length and why this is important e.g. for analyzers that decompose terms such as Lucenes WorldDelimiter Analyzer and IntraFinds German Analyzer which also does word decomposition.","start_time":"2015-01-31T15:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T15:45:00.000Z","track":"Open source search","location":"UA2.114 (Baudoux)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/the_typed_index/"},

{"title":"OpenLISP: Open source Locator/ID Separation Protocol implementation ","subtitle":"","speakers":["Luigi Iannone"],"description":"In the last years both academia and industry have worked toward new Internet architecture proposals, due to the awareness that the current architecture is facing unforeseen scalability issues, concerning the restless increase of the BGP routing tables, addressing, mobility, multihoming, and inter-domain traffic engineering.\nThe general consensus is that splitting the locator and identifier roles of IP addresses solves these issues and is necessary for the Future Internet architecture.\nHowever, in practice, several constraints have to be taken into account in order to design a viable solution that can be incrementally deployed, without disrupting the existing communication infrastructure, whilst providing benefits, hence incentives, for early adopters.\nAn instance of such a paradigm is the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP). LISP was first proposed by Cisco in the IRTF (Internet Research Task Force) and is now under development in the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). Aiming at being incrementally deployable, LISP has evolved from its initial design in order to accommodate the constraints that the current Internet imposes, but still offering an effective solution for the scalability issues.\nOur goal is not to convince the reader about the merits of LISP, or the general Locator/ID Split paradigm, and neither to provide numerical results of its performance.\nRather, the talk aims providing an overview on how LISP works and what are the basic principles, including its implementation aspects.","start_time":"2015-01-31T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T11:30:00.000Z","track":"Network management and SDN","location":"UD2.218A","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/openlisp/"},
{"title":"High-performance packet filtering with Pflua","subtitle":"","speakers":["Andy Wingo"],"description":"Packet filtering generally works by taking pflang expressions and compiling them to bytecode for the BPF virtual machine. Pflua, a new pflang implementation, instead compiles pflang expressions to Lua code, which are then optimized at run-time to native machine code by a trace compiler (LuaJIT). Tracing seems a particularly appropriate strategy for the packet filtering use case, as you end up with linear machine code that reflects the shape of actual network traffic.\n\nPflua is a project that lives at the intersection of networking and compilers. Its pflang to Lua compiler builds an AST that is exhaustively optimized, folding constants and tests, inferring ranges of expressions and packet offset values, hoisting assertions that post-dominate success  continuations, etc. For compatibility, pflua also has a BPF bytecode to Lua compiler, whch leaves the first layer of compilation to libpcap, while benefitting from pflua's much better run-time performance.\n\nJoin us in this Pflua presentation and learn about:\n\n<ul>\n<li> The architecture of Pflua.</li>\n<li> Compiler optimization techniques implemented in Pflua.</li>\n<li> Benchmarking. How Pflua compares to other packet-filtering solutions. Spoiler: it is sometimes several times faster.</li>\n<li> Real-world demo: filtering with pflua and Snabb Switch.</li>\n</ul>\n","start_time":"2015-01-31T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T12:30:00.000Z","track":"Network management and SDN","location":"UD2.218A","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/packet_filtering_pflua/"},

While implementing it, we've met a number of issues coming from different parts of different Netlink subsystems. No one of the issues is a bug sensu stricto, but all of them seriously affect the final implementation.\n\nSo, it would be nice to share and discuss shortly the experience of the implementation solutions. Almost every low-level network related project has to work with the Netlink features and issues, and some of this knowledge can and, probably, should be generalized.\n\nThe agenda of the discussion is to show Netlink tricks and their impact on different levels: from the lowest protocol level to the high-level OS network setup. Will be prepared a demo of different projects interoperability, including Netlink proxying.","start_time":"2015-01-31T15:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T15:30:00.000Z","track":"Network management and SDN","location":"UD2.218A","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/pyroute2_netlink/"},

Writing a C or Java extension exposes some of these concepts to the Rubyist and highlights the uniqueness of the language. I would like to share some of what I've learned from writing C and Java extensions with the RubyConf audience.\n\nIn this presentation I'll use an example of writing a C extension so that Ruby code can make use of a third-party C security library. The topics I'll touch on are:\n\nHow to write a rake task so that your extension compiles when your gem installs\nHow Ruby objects are represented in C code\nThe appropriate C functions to use when going back and forth between Ruby objects and C code\n\nHere is the c code: https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/blob/1.x-stable/ext/csasl/csasl.c\n\nWhy I'm qualified as a speaker on this topic:\n\nI had to write both a Java and C extension for the MongoDB Ruby driver using a sasl library for GSSAPI authentication against MongoDB. There was minimal documentation available for how to write extensions in Java or C and I learned a ton from having to figure it out on my own.\nHaving written the extensions gives me a much deeper understanding of MRI in particular and general knowledge about programming languages.\n\nI've given numerous talks at conferences, including RubyConf '13, invited to BaRuCo '14, RailsConf '13, RailsIsrael, RuLu, GoGaRuCo '13, GoRuCo '13, ScottishRuby, etc. I love giving talks and put a lot of heart and soul into the preparation.

While not offering the full feature set of robust and mature packages such as Pari/GP and SAGE, there are many areas where this package offers improvements.\n\nWith implementations in C, C+GMP, and Perl, there were a number of design choices made.  We describe the choices and tradeoffs of making a package that is both portable, robust, and performant.  Design choices for some algorithms (e.g. primality tests) are also discussed.\n\nHighlights of this open source package include:\n  - Fastest single threaded open source prime count and nth<em>prime\n  - Fastest 64-bit primality testing\n  - Fastest bigint probable prime testing to 10k digits\n  - Fastest next</em>prime, prev_prime\n  - Fastest open source AKS primality proofs\n  - Fastest open source ECPP primality proofs\n  - Support for random primes and random proven primes\n  - Ability to compile standalone C programs for tasks such as prime count, primality tests, primality proving, and primality certificate verification.\n\nThe random primes and primality testing/proving have been used in some new crypto modules, replacing older CPAN modules that were slower and had defects.  The ECPP verifier written as part of this project is being used by FactorDB.  In less than a year of use, simple Perl scripts using this module have been able to find over 37% of all current record prime gaps.

Further changes and improvements are now on the way thanks to input from academic users using SDAPS both for surveys and examinations. Especially examinations pose a unique challange as there is a multitude of different ways to conduct these, making custom data processing and workflows necessary.

{"title":"Introducing SILE: A New Typesetting System","subtitle":"","speakers":["Simon Cozens"],"description":"Hello, my name's Simon and I wrote a typesetting system by mistake. Then I found out that people needed to use it. Come and hear about how SILE got started, how it's developed since then, and how you can use it to make printed documents.\n\nSILE is a typesetter designed to meet the needs of a particular translation community, with an emphasis on extensibility and layout flexibility. Existing solutions (TeX and friends) were not able to provide the required features in these areas, and so translators and publishers have been looking around for an alternative solution for many years. SILE takes a lot of inspiration from TeX, but updates many of its ideas to match the changes in the software ecosystem in the past 35 years.\n\nSILE does not, however, aim to be a replacement for TeX, but is a separate system for document layout and rendering. Because of this, functionality which is a challenge for TeX users - for instance, laying out text on a grid, or magazine-style frame based layouts - becomes very easy in SILE. SILE is written in an interpreted language, so parts of the system's operation, including core typesetting algorithms, can be redefined at run time.\n\nSILE is also designed to meet the realities of today's data processing. Documents these days are often prepared in authoring software and stored in XML format. This applies both to document-specific XML DTDs, such as DocBook and the Text Encoding Initiative, and also tagged text database formats, such as those for storing linguistic and other annotation data such as the LIFT standard for dictionary data and the USX format used by translators. SILE classes can define processing expectations for XML elements, which means that XML files can then be read in and typeset directly. We will look at examples of complex book layouts driven by XML data sources.","start_time":"2015-01-31T14:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T14:50:00.000Z","track":"Typesetting","location":"Janson","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/introducing_sile/"},
{"title":"Algorithmic Graph Drawing in TikZ","subtitle":"","speakers":["Till Tantau"],"description":"Visualizing graphs is a time-consuming and complicated process, even when the to-be-drawn graphs have only a few nodes, and thus best left to special graph drawing algorithms. At the heart of every good such algorithm lies an efficient procedure for assigning canvas positions to a graph's nodes and the bend points of its edges. However, every real-world implementation of such an algorithm must address numerous problems that have little to do with the actual algorithm, like handling input and output formats, formatting node texts, or typesetting node texts and edge labels. In the talk I will present a new framework, implemented in the Lua programming language and integrated into the TikZ graphics description language, that aims at simplifying the implementation of graph drawing algorithms.

{"title":"The CHERI CPU","subtitle":"RISC in the age of risk","speakers":["David Chisnall"],"description":"2014 saw memory safety vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed in the mainstream press on several times, yet modern CPUs provide a memory model that does nothing to prevent them.  Modern security-critical applications such as web browsers split themselves into components to minimise the damage done by a compromise, but are forced to do so using hardware mechanisms (the MMU) designed to protect small numbers of programs from each other and which don't scale to the hundreds or thousands of components that modern software demands.\n\nThe CHERI research CPU was created to attempt to apply the RISC philosophy to addressing these problems: To provide a simple hardware primitive that could be used to enforce everything from object-granularity memory protection to library-granularity sandboxing, with the policy under the control of software.  The resulting design has undergone several significant revisions and is the focus of ongoing research on OS and programming language security policies.\n\nOur software stack uses a modified FreeBSD and LLVM/Clang, co-designed along with the CPU.  This allows us to evaluate real programs, running at a useable (if not spectacular) speed.","start_time":"2015-01-31T09:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T09:50:00.000Z","track":"Security","location":"K.1.105 (La Fontaine)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/the_cheri_cpu/"},

{"title":"LuaRocks - fostering an ecosystem of Lua modules","subtitle":"Creating the package manager for the Lua language","speakers":["Hisham Muhammad"],"description":"<h2>Full Description</h2>\n\nThis talk will present LuaRocks, the package manager for modules for the Lua programming language.\n\nLua has been used for many years as a scripting language embedded into applications. It has been especially successful in the gaming industry, being present in several AAA titles. Its ease of embeddability, good performance and small footprint have been major factors it this success.\n\nHowever, its minimalistic, \"no-batteries-included\" design has also prevented it from getting much traction as a stand-alone application development language. A major setback was the lack of an easy way to integrate extension libraries for various tasks (such as sockets, databases, UI, XML/JSON, etc.)\n\nLuaRocks was created to target this problem. It is a package manager designed for Lua modules (written in Lua or C). It serves both as a package manager in the style of RubyGems or npm, and also as a build system for compiling C code into Lua modules.\n\nThis talk will discuss the particular challenges of developing a package manager for Lua. Some are technical challenges, related to portability; some are social challenges that reflect into technical issues, such as the lack of established practices.\n\nWith the LuaRocks project, we've been successfully fostering an ecosystem of extension modules for Lua. The repositories keep growing, and the dependencies between modules show that reuse is increasing.\n\n<h2>About the presenter</h2>\n\nHisham Muhammad (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) — lead developer of <a href=\"http://luarocks.org\">LuaRocks</a>.

It's easy to make mistakes that make people waste their time, or that compromise security.\n\nSince PGP signatures are widely used in Free Software development (for instance for signing packages), it's important to make the process as reliable as possible.\n\nSignatures are also important for end users. Important packages like GPG or Tor are signed.

{"title":"All your cycles are belong to us","subtitle":"Volunteer computing in the age of the ubiquituous browser","speakers":["Juan Julián Merelo"],"description":"Volunteer computing was started thanks to lack of funds and surplus of computing power (and connectivity to go with it) on the hands of labs and companies. Stealth computing was proposed initially by Barabasi to take advantage of devices connected to the network that perform very basic computations. There's a very fine line between them, a line that includes a button that says \"Click here\" or the will to not use resources more than those dutifully allotted by the operating system. There are also usability differences between volunteer and stealth computing and maybe ethical and legal ones. However, from the point of view of the computing model and the techniques involved, there is no difference.\nIn this talk we will explore the possibilities of stealth/volunteer computing using mainly the browser and the issues involved with it. The main one is performance, either from the algorithmic point of view or CPU-cycles-wise. How many CPU cycles could be achievable using them? Is it predictable in a way? And there is an intriguing edge to the performance model: it includes the fact that there will be a big dependence on the web page that is used itself, from its content, to its search engine position, to the way it is announced in social networks and by whom.\nEven as there is some predictability in the whole experiment, from the algorithmic point of view it is impossible to know, in advance, how long a particular user is going to stay contributing to the system and when he's going to come and go. This is an issue that has to be leveraged in the algorithm so that these cycles contributed actually add something to the whole experiment and do not detract from it. We will specially talk about population-based algorithms, which are the ones we do have a certain experience with, but any algorithm that has some dependencies (that is, anything that goes beyond brute-force approach) will experience similar issues.\nFinally, there are some trust issues that must also be taken into account. There are purely legal issues, but stealthy volunteer (or voluntarily stealth) computing should follow open science best practices, since that is the only way of managing a healthy and sustainable meta-computing device where people or citizens have a huge role.","start_time":"2015-01-31T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T12:15:00.000Z","track":"Lightning talks","location":"H.2215 (Ferrer)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/volunteer_computing/"},

Doing it this way allows you to exactly define how a system should look like after the upgrade or patching. Nothing else can be installed, removed or configured.\n\nFurthermore, many checks can be build-in via adding simple scripts. We also keep of each run an unique log file, and furthermore, we keep evidence before and after patching in a special directory.

{"title":"Leihs, the leading free equipment booking system","subtitle":"It took us eight years to get it right. What we learned about being a FOSS project.","speakers":["Ramón Cahenzli"],"description":"leihs began as a small internal project, written when Ruby on Rails was still young and considered cutting-edge technology. Deployment was messy and unreliable, the code had to be changed significantly with every Rails upgrade and even Ruby itself had a few pretty bad bugs at the time. But we stuck with it and rewrote the core and most of the interface for version 2.0. This was the initial version of leihs released under the GPL. Later GitHub came along, and so leihs went there. With GitHub came some popularity, and the project really took off when we redesigned the user interface yet again, this time with real interaction designers.\n\nThe main takeaways from eight years of free software development:\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you choose a technology that's immature, things get very exciting. But be prepared to rewrite your code again and again as the foundation you built on shifts.</li>\n<li>Don't add internationalization at a later time, do it from the start. One of my biggest regrets is not going with a complete German/English interface from the start.</li>\n<li>Make sure your management understands what it means to do free software, and that you can't just do your own thing. Be part of your own community. Comment on bug reports, write change logs, have a project blog -- if you treat the community as if it isn't there, it will soon not be there anymore.</li>\n<li>If you're doing something with a GUI and don't have interaction- or UX people, hire professionals to do it for you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nleihs has now been installed at some very important universities and colleges in and outside Switzerland. I want to encourage anyone who is paid with taxpayer money to develop free software and to politely urge their management into letting them do it.

{"title":"Open source home automation","subtitle":"by OpenMotics","speakers":["Frederick Ryckbosch"],"description":"OpenMotics is an open source home automation hardware and software system that offers features like switching lights and outputs, multi-zone heating and cooling, power measurements, and automated actions. The system encompases both open source software and hardware. For interoperability with other systems, the OpenMotics Gateway provides an API through which various actions can be executed.\n\nOpen source software: Download, adjust and recompile the source code of our Home Automation Modules; licensing as GPLv2.\n\nOpen hardware: Download the PCB files (including BOM and schematics) to create, adjust and manufacture your own hardware; licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\nThe project first started 10 years ago with basic hardware modules for switches and outputs. Since then the number of modules has increased to create an extensible full-featured home automation system. The modules include a Gateway module that is the heart of the system which drives all other modules. An Input module for reading the status of the switches. An Output module that toggles lights, outlets or other devices. And others like a Dim Control module, a Sensor module and a Power module for measuring the power consumed by each appliance in your home.\n\nTwo years ago we decided to open source the software running on the Gateway module, all firmware running on the other modules and the schematics and PCBs (printed circuit boards) for all modules. The choice to open source the project was very conscious—at OpenMotics we believe there are three fundamental problems with the existing commercial home automation offerings.\n\nThe first problem concerns the price: home automation systems tend to be ridiculously expensive for the features that they offer. Most vendors target the high-end market with fully integrated custom solutions. The alternative is using open source software like OpenHAB to stitch together components from different vendors. With OpenMotics we offer a complete solution that is easy to install, configure and use, at a fair price.\n\nThe second problem is that many home automation systems are not maintainable by the customer, and every change to the system requires an installer to come by at location to make the changes. We believe a home, and how it is used, changes over the years and the owner should be able to modify the configuration of his home automation system to reflect this. Compare this to a smartphone where you don't have to run to the shop every time you want to install a new app. So why should your home automation system be any different? Why shouldn't we be in full control of our own homes?\n\nFor more tech-savvy users, the inability to configure your own system brings us to the third problem: most proprietary systems use closed communication protocols and you—as a user—are not able to interface or change anything. Everybody has ideas on how they could make their home better, a home automation system should enable the user to implement these improvements. We tackled this problem on three different levels.\n\nFirst, as described above, the user is in full control over the configuration of the system and can change it at any time. For techy users, we provide a plugin mechanism on the Gateway module: any self written or community developed plugin can be installed through the secure web interface. These plugins can communicate with the modules, catch events like lights turning on or off, expose a web interface and communicate with other services. The possibilities are up to your own imagination. And third, because the software and hardware are both open source, an electronics and/or software enthusiast can modify both hardware and software at will, or even create their own modules. Or you can just use the system as is, with lots of features readily available.","start_time":"2015-01-31T15:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T15:15:00.000Z","track":"Lightning talks","location":"H.2215 (Ferrer)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/home_automation/"},

{"title":"Observability in KVM","subtitle":"How to troubleshoot virtual machines","speakers":["Stefan Hajnoczi"],"description":"The KVM hypervisor is part of the Linux kernel, making it an easy and popular way to run virtual machines on Linux hosts.  KVM is also the most well supported and popular hypervisor deployed with OpenStack, typically through the libvirt library.\n\nWhen something goes wrong with a virtual machine there are often questions like \"how do I see the network packets that the host is receiving for this virtual machine?\" or \"can I find out which virtual machine is causing excessive disk I/O?\".\n\nLuckily KVM is not a black box, it's an open source hypervisor that runs together with the userspace QEMU emulator.  There are a wealth of tools for observing virtual machine activity and they can be used to troubleshoot failures and performance issues.  From packet sniffing to CPU profilers, tracing to debuggers, this talk covers the arsenal of tools and how to apply them.\n\nThis presentation arms you with knowledge of KVM's architecture and how to observe virtual machine activity.  Monitoring and debugging virtual machines is actually much like (and sometimes even easier than) on physical machines so you can reuse many familiar tools.\n\nOnce you understand how virtual machines interact with the outside world, how CPU, RAM, disk I/O, and network resources are connected, investigating issues with virtual machines becomes a systematic process.  This presentation includes examples of common questions you can ask with the help of performance monitoring and debugging tools.\n\nThis talk is suitable for both users of KVM virtual machines and developers of management software like libvirt, OpenStack, or oVirt.  The aim is share knowledge gained from real-world cases so that virtual machines are not just a joy to use, but also a powerful vehicle for observability.","start_time":"2015-01-31T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T12:40:00.000Z","track":"Virtualisation","location":"UD2.120 (Chavanne)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/observability/"},
{"title":"Transplantation of VirtualBox to the NOVA microhypervisor","subtitle":"","speakers":["Norman Feske"],"description":"Commodity open-source virtualization solutions like Qemu/KVM and VirtualBox have received tremendous work and hand-crafted heuristics to enable a wide range of unmodified guest operating systems to run flawlessly inside virtual machines. On the other hand, those commodity virtualization solutions rely on a highly complex trusted computing base. Speaking of VirtualBox, the user has to ultimately trust the VirtualBox application in addition to the host OS kernel because VirtualBox exercises all-encompassing control over the host system. This high complexity comes with a high likelihood for bugs and thereby represents a large attack surface that puts the security and privacy of the user at risk.\n\nWith the NOVA virtualization architecture, there exists an alternative approach where the complex parts of the virtualization platform are executed in the form of unprivileged components on top of a low-complexity hybrid microkernel/hypervisor. The hypervisor solely provides mechanisms to segregate platform resources, to enable secure inter-component communication, and to reflect virtualization events to user-level virtual-machine monitors. This way, the effective isolation between virtual machines as well as components that run beside virtual machines depends on a trusted computing base of less than one percent compared to commodity virtualization solutions. On the downside, the beauty of the architecture has not gained much attention because NOVA's existing user-level virtual machine monitor lacked the feature set and out-of-the box experience of mature virtualization products.\n\nThe talk will present how the feature-rich VirtualBox virtual machine monitor was brought to the NOVA microhypervisor using the Genode OS framework as user-level infrastructure. It will start with an overview of the VirtualBox architecture on the traditional platforms, followed by a brief introduction into the world of NOVA and Genode. The main part of the talk will explain the methodology of the transplantation work and the challenges that had to be overcome. Finally, it will outline the benefits and possible future directions of combining both technologies.\n\nThe presentation will be held using a Genode/NOVA system, which will also be used for a live demonstration.","start_time":"2015-01-31T13:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T13:40:00.000Z","track":"Virtualisation","location":"UD2.120 (Chavanne)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/transplantation/"},

{"title":"Can Distros Make the Link? Let's Package the Customizable, Free Software Web of the Future! ","subtitle":"","speakers":["Deb Nicholson"],"description":"Let's be honest. Most of the people who currently run a node of a decentralized web service are pretty technical. The rest of the world uses massive centralized services. These large centralized service providers are prone to easy surveillance, hard for users to customize and rife with arbitrary censorship. But people want to connect and share, so if we aren't building free web services for everyone, then we may as well not be building them at all.\n\nGNU/Linux distributions could well be the missing link. If users could install the software to host their own node of MediaGoblin, Diaspora or Pump.io as easily as they choose an application like VLC or Audacity then we might start to see the multi-node network that federated services need to succeed. Of course, there are a few hurdles we'll have to overcome before we can expect easily deployable federation in every distro. Some of the great new innovations from the world of devops (prepare for all the failure) and the magic of containerization (assemble once, deploy everywhere) could help us bridge the gap.\n\nIt's time for the folks who are building the distros of the future and the folks who are building the web of the future to see what we can offer each other. The folks at MediaGoblin have been thinking about this for quite a while. Come hear what we've done so far, where we think the tricky bits will be and then join us in building the computing, sharing, connecting environment of the future!","start_time":"2015-01-31T13:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T13:45:00.000Z","track":"Distributions","location":"H.1302 (Depage)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/can_distros_make_the_link?_lets_package_the_customizable,_free_software_web_of_the_future!_/"},

Write a property that should always be true (like \"this code should have the same result before and after it's optimized\"), generate random valid expressions, and study the counter-examples!\n\nProperty-based testing is a powerful technique for finding bugs quickly. It can partly replace unit tests, leading to a more flexible test suite that generates more cases and finds more bugs in less time.\n\nIt's really quick and easy to get started with property-based testing. You can use existing tools like QuickCheck, or write your own: Andy Windo and I wrote pflua-quickcheck and found a half-dozen bugs with it in one afternoon, using pure Lua and no external libraries.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce property-based testing, demonstrate a tool for using it in Lua - and how to write your own property-based testing tool from scratch, and explain how simple properties found bugs in pflua.","start_time":"2015-01-31T13:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T13:45:00.000Z","track":"Testing and automation","location":"H.1309 (Van Rijn)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/property_based_testing/"},
{"title":"Make your tests fail","subtitle":"How randomisation adds a whole new dimension to finding bugs in your code","speakers":["Isabel Drost-Fromm"],"description":"Writing unit and integration tests can be tricky: assumptions about your code may not always be true as any number of \"this should never happen\" log entries in production systems show. When implementing a system that will be integrated in all sorts of expected, unexpected, and outright weird ways by downstream users, testing all possible code paths, configurations and deployment environments gets complicated.\n\nWith the Carrotsearch Randomised Testing framework, projects like Apache Lucene and Elasticsearch have introduced a new level to their unit and integration tests. Input values are no longer statically pre-defined but are generated based on developer defined constraints, meaning The test suite is no longer re-run with a static set of input data each time. Instead, every continuous integration run adds to the search space covered. Though generated at random, tests are still reproducible as all configurations are based on specific test seeds that can be used to re-run the test with the exact same configuration.\n\nAdd to this randomising the runtime environment by executing tests with various JVM versions and configurations,and you are bound to find cases where your application runs into limitations and bugs in the JVM.\n\nThis talk introduces randomised testing as a concept, shows examples of how the Carrotsearch Randomised Testing framework helps with making your test cases more interesting, and provides some insight into how randomising your execution environment can help save downstream users from surprises. All without putting too much strain on your continuous integration resources.","start_time":"2015-01-31T14:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T14:45:00.000Z","track":"Testing and automation","location":"H.1309 (Van Rijn)","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/make_your_tests_fail/"},

{"title":"Orchestrating computer systems, a new protocol","subtitle":"Introducing ZOCP an orchestration protocol for live performances, rapid prototyping and the IoT","speakers":["Arnaud Loonstra"],"description":"In this presentation we present the ZOCP protocol which overcomes the situations mentioned below. The ZOCP protocol is designed with the following in mind:\n\n<ul>\n<li>KISS (Keep it simple and stupid): We want this protocol not be in our way and we want to be able to understand it easily.</li>\n<li>Zero Configuration: The protocol should be able to handle most, if not all configuration by itself. There is no need for setting up specific parameters unless requested, aka convention over configuration.</li>\n<li>Runs on anything TCP/IP: Since TCP/IP is the de facto standard for devices to communicate the technology should be able to run on any device that is able to talk TCP/IP</li>\n<li>Open Standards: All used technologies, software, protocols should be freely and openly available.</li>\n<li>Low latency, when needed</li>\n<li>Reliability, when needed</li>\n<li>Unintrusive debugging and monitoring</li>\n</ul>\n\n\nAs artists embrace new technologies as an artistic medium, these technologies often provide artists with new methods for cooperation. Networking technologies are used frequently for these purposes. Internet has been a driving force behind the development of networking hardware and open standards for connecting any to device to any device. These technologies are now a commodity and thus available for anybody to use. However we see a rising need to be able to implement these technologies in a flexible adaptive manner without the explicit fixed configurations requiring manual configuration.\n\nOpen Sound Control (OSC) is a protocol developed for exchanging music performance data. OSC is often used as an alternative to MIDI, however, it has found its way to many use cases besides musical performances. We have found OSC to be an ideal de facto standard for connecting applications to each other in order to orchestrate them. However the flexibility of OSC tends to decrease exponentially when used in large configurations because of its hard-coded nature. This implies that many applications need to be instructed to use specific manual settings and agreements in order for applications to communicate. In large configurations containing multiple systems and multiple applications, this manual work is inflexible and error prone.\n\nThe current prototype is developed using the ZeroMQ framework. We will demonstrate the protocol in a setup with Blender, a game engine, an Urwid console monitor and a RaspberryPi.","start_time":"2015-01-31T09:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T09:25:00.000Z","track":"Internet of things","location":"H.2213","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/deviot02/"},

Just like email, you can either run your own Matrix homeserver, which means you own and control your own communications and history - or you can use one hosted by someone else (e.g. matrix.org) - there is no single point of control or mandatory service provider in Matrix.  In fact, there is no single point of control over conversations in Matrix at all - conversation history is a first class citizen, with room state replicated over all participating servers, avoiding single-points of failure or control as you get in XMPP MUCs.\n\nWith the continously increasing number of devices connected to the internet, we need ways to gather and unify all the status and instruction data going back and forth - and Matrix is a perfect fit for these kind of services.","start_time":"2015-01-31T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T10:25:00.000Z","track":"Internet of things","location":"H.2213","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/deviot04/"},

The embedded systems we have in mind for the Internet of Things might be more in the region of a few megabytes of flash and ram.\n\nThe Linux kernel has been growing in size over the years; growing in features also. But a lot of the development has been focused on supporting more CPU’s, more memory, more high-end stuff to support supercomputer-like systems. The minimum possible kernel size has increased with almost every release.\n\nAn ongoing effort exists to try and tinify the Linux kernel, with these embedded systems in mind. There is the Tiny wiki1, LWN article on Kernel tinification2 and the LWN article on Networking on tiny machines3.\n\nBeing embedded system developers, getting inspired by these articles, and being the creators of picoTCP, we thought of pushing the tinification a step further: Replace the Kernel’s TCP/IP stack with picoTCP. picoTCP is a free TCP/IP stack designed for embedded systems.\nIn a typical ucLinux kernel the network functionality is over 500 kb; that can be 1/4th of the kernel!\n\nThe talk will start with a demo of picoTCP inside the Linux kernel, running on an STM32F4 Cortex-M4 microcontroller. Then, we’ll show some figures on why this is important, and explain the steps taken to strip the default TCP/IP stack from the kernel and replace it with picoTCP; reducing the kernel size by over 300 kb.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://tiny.wiki.kernel.org/\nhttp://lwn.net/Articles/608945/\nhttp://lwn.net/Articles/597529/\n\nuC Linux kernel size - nominal - = 2.1 MB\nuC Linux kernel size - No Network Support - = 1.5 MB\nuC Linux kernel size - No TCP, but drivers - = 1.67 MB (1,749,216 b)\nuC Linux kernel size - PicoTCP (ipv4, dns client, arp, tcp, udp, icmp) - = 1,790,912 b (+ 41696 bytes = 40.7 kB)","start_time":"2015-01-31T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T12:25:00.000Z","track":"Internet of things","location":"H.2213","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/deviot08/"},

{"title":"Genode - OS security by design","subtitle":"","speakers":["Norman Feske"],"description":"The effects of malware and client-side attacks seem to have become a prevalent part of our inter-connected world and increasingly affect individuals, businesses, and governmental institutions alike. The topic has even managed to capture the attention of main-stream media, prompting vocal calls for counter-measures. Governments invest large sums in forming cyber-defense departments. Computer users are urged to invest money in anti-virus software and install a steady stream of security updates. However, those actions are just reactive, fighting symptoms, and merely relieve the problem rather than solving it. For example, none of those measures is effective against zero-day exploits.\n\nThe root of the problem is not the \"dumb user\", or \"outdated anti-virus software\", or \"cyber terrorists\" but the antiquated way of how today's operating systems are structured, how they implement security, and the chaotic way of how software components are allowed to interact with each other.\n\nGenode is an operating-system architecture that promises to prevent most classes of security problems by design. Genode-based systems are created out of surprisingly simple primitives: Each program runs in a dedicated sandbox and gets granted only those rights and resources that are needed for its actual task. Programs can create and manage sub-sandboxes out of their own resources, thereby forming hierarchies where policies can be enforced at each level. Furthermore, programs are able to communicate and trade their resources, but only in a well-defined manner. Thanks to this rigid regime, the attack surface of security-critical functions can be reduced by orders of magnitude compared to contemporary operating systems.\n\nThis sounds pretty academic but there exists an Open-Source implementation in the form of the Genode OS Framework showing that those ideas translate to a general-purpose OS. In line with Unix philosophy, this framework is a collection of small building blocks, out of which complex systems can be composed. But unlike Unix, those building blocks include not only applications but all classical OS functionalities including kernels, device drivers, file systems, and protocol stacks.\n\nDuring the talk, we will see several of those compositions demonstrated, hinting at the vast flexibility the architecture provides. At present, this makes Genode a rich playground for OS enthusiasts. The ultimate goal, however, is a fully-fledged operating system that protects the user's privacy and data, and relieves us from worrying about malware, virus infections, and directed attacks. The talk will show how Genode renders various classes of malware pointless and how the Genode developers envision their migration path from current-generation OSes to Genode.","start_time":"2015-01-31T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T11:25:00.000Z","track":"Security devroom","location":"AW1.120","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/genode_os_security_by_design/"},

This is mecanic uses links, security extended attribute, and groups.\n\nThe launcher setups the namespace environment using namespaces and the authorised keys and launches the target application.\n\nThe key manager is a high efficient server that allows any service to ask if a process has a given key.\n\nThe mecanism of the authorisation keys allow privileges to be given once, never or to be asked by some popup daemon.\n\nThe key manager is made using a virtual filesystem implemented using FUSE for prototyping.

The modified algorithm describes a way to decide on the go which points are essentials (and need to be stored). With the Douglas_Peucker two criteria can be used : the maximum number of points to retain, or the maximum error tolerated. In the modified algorithm only the max error tolerated can be being. Because the algorithm cannot predict the future length of the polyline, it's not possible to apply the maximum number of points. Examples shown contains 2D and 3D cases, in comparison with the Douglas-Peucker algorithm.

{"title":"PicoTCP on Mobile Ad Hoc networks","subtitle":"","speakers":["Brecht Van Cauwenberghe"],"description":"Introduction:\nIn a world where even the smallest electronic devices have the ability to acquire huge amounts of data which is only relevant when it can be shared to other instances. The demand to make them interconnected is exponentially growing. While the on-board resources of these small and cheap sensor devices/nodes are growing, it has become possible to tackle such networking requirements. The possibilities of a network, consisting of such nodes, which is self configuring and highly adaptable in topology instantly become endless(see Mobile Ad Hoc Networks a.k.a. MANET). Because every node should act independent from one another and it's not mandatory for two nodes in the network to have direct Line Of Sight(LOS) connection, ad hoc wireless networks can't rely on a centralized gateway to configure and manage the network traffic. The traditional wireless networking/routing protocols are not able to comply to these needs, so another approach was required to be designed.\n\nMANET routing Challenges:\nThe requirements of a simple MANET on sensor nodes is by itself quite complex due to their dynamic nature. Depending on the requirements of the application it can be useful to make network topology discovered proactive or reactive. In other words one could ask the question, does a node need to have the route to his destination available when transmitting a message or can it be obtained on the fly? This naturally creates a higher latency than when a route is proactively defined and stored. This would be the case in a table driven approach which regularly exchanges topology info. In contrast, it's obvious that reactive routing protocols will respond faster on topology changes than protocols that are relying on their legacy proactive routing tables. And then there is chance to flood the network! What if for every packet sent over the network, information about the topology has to be obtained as is the case with reactive routing protocols. This will intensively decrease the throughput of the mesh network.\nSo, a lot of open questions need to be answered in order to optimize mesh networking on sensor nodes. So the brains of routing protocol designers started grinding to concur these challenges! As a result several RFC's on routing protocols have been designed during the last years. Two examples worth mentioning are \"Optimized Link State Routing\"(OLSR) and \"Ad hoc On-Demand Vector routing\"(AODV). These are respectively proactive and reactive routing protocols.\n\nMAC and PHY:\nOne should always keep in mind that in networking context the software solutions are constrained by the hardware they are targeting. There are several PHY and MAC layer possibilities of which the following two are frequently used in the mesh networking field. First we have the IEEE802.11 collection of standards which is also known as wifi, and mostly focused on high data rates. Second there is the IEEE802.15.4 standard which is the basis for Zigbee, 6LoWPAN, etc. The latter focuses more on low power devices. Depending on the needs of the application or the compliance required, the one can be preferred above the other.\n\nRouting Protocol:\nBecause picoTCP already supports IPv4 (more info at www.picotcp.com), the step towards developing a mesh networking solution was obvious. So the next problem was to select the best fitting protocol to our current stack implementation and mesh networking goals. Since we take RFC compliance very serious which implies that for IPv4 all devices should be able to handle a minimal datagram size of 576 bytes, the best wireless standard for IPv4 will be the 802.11 standard(wifi). Since this standard is mostly focused on high data rates, the focus went to protocols that provide high throughput and low latency behavior. From all these restrictions we came to the OLSR protocol as best fitting solution.\n\nOLSR or Optimized Link State Routing protocol is a proactive routing protocol that uses 4 types of OLSR messages to establish the link state routing tables for every node. Every OLSR supporting node will send \"HELLO\" messages to its neighbors to find his one hop neighbors and two hop neighbors from the responses. The router between a two hop neighbor, or multipoint relay(MPR), is to be selected by each node and added to his MPR-selector set. Only the nodes selected as MPR are responsible to send \"Topology Control\" (TC) messages that contain a set of links to at least all nodes in his MPR-selector set. Network flooding is optimized, because only MPRs are sending TC messages and they are using their MPRs to broadcast the towards the reset of the network, hence the Optimization in OLSR. The third type of messages are the \"Multiple Interface Declaration\" (MID) messages, used to transmit information about its interfaces if the node has more than one. The last message type, used in OLSR, are the \"Host and Network Association\" (HNA) messages, which enable the ability to inject external routing information into the MANET.\n\nSlot:\nThis was a summary about how picoTCP supports mesh networking, and why picoTCP has preferred OLSR as mesh routing protocol. In the presentation we will go deeper into how to use picoTCP and the several ways we simulate mesh network behavior(including a custom created Geomesh simulator and the Contiki Cooja simulator). To finalize, the results of a real life implementation on the physical Wilab-t mesh network, located at Ghent University will also be explained.","start_time":"2015-01-31T15:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T15:10:00.000Z","track":"Geospatial","location":"AW1.121","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/picotcp_networks/"},

{"title":"Synthesizing gateware with GCC","subtitle":"Bambu: A Free Framework for the High-Level Synthesis of Complex Applications","speakers":["Fabrizio Ferrandi"],"description":"Programmable devices such as FPGAs can potentially offer very significant computational power, but implementing efficient solutions on them can be a hard task. One\nof the main obstacles is the usage of hardware description language (HDL), whose knowledge is usually a rare expertise.\nTo overcome or at least to mitigate this issue, High Level Synthesis (HLS) has been introduced: a (semi)-automatic design flow, potentially composed of several methodologies, that\nstarting from a high level representation of the specification to be implemented (e.g., from its C/C++ source code implementation) produces its hardware implementation.\nThis talk presents Bambu a free HLS tools based on GCC developed at Politecnico di Milano, that generated synthesizable HDL description starting from ANSI specifications.\nIn particular, Bambu receives as input a behavioral description of the algorithm, written in ANSI C language, and generates a Verilog description of the corresponding RTL implementation as output, along with a test-bench for the simulation and validation of the behavior. This HDL description is then compatible with commercial RTL synthesis tools.\nBambu has a compiler-based interface interacting with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) (version 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9 are currently supported) and builds the internal representation in Static Single Assignment form of the initial C code.\nFloating point operations are supported through FloPoCo (http://flopoco.gforge.inria.fr/), a generator of arithmetic Floating-Point Cores or through directly synthesis of a softfloat based C description.\nBambu provides the automatic generation of synthesis and simulation scripts based on XML configuration. This feature allows the automatic characterization of the resource library, providing technology-aware details during the High-Level Synthesis. The tools for RTL-synthesis currently supported are: Xilinx ISE, Xilinx VIVADO, Altera Quartus and Lattice Diamond; and simulation tools: Mentor Modelsim, Xilinx ISIM, Xilinx XSIM, Verilog Icarus and Verilator.","start_time":"2015-01-31T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T12:15:00.000Z","track":"Electronic design automation","location":"AW1.124","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/bambu/"},

{"title":"Viterbi's little Helper","subtitle":"Coprocessor strategies for Forward Error Correction","speakers":["Jan Kraemer"],"description":"Convolutional Codes have been known for a long time. Viterbi established his algorithm to decode convolutional encoded data in the year 1967 [1]. SDR has also been established since the late 90’s and early 00’s. But still the implementation of convolutional decoders, such as the Viterbi- or MAP-algorithm, in software has always been a problem. Both algorithms rely on a Hidden Markoff Model as the encoder is simply a Mealy Machine. So if one surveys every possible state transition caused by a bit stream, a trellis structure is created. For every encoded information bit you have to consider all possible transitions from one state to another [1][2]. This leads to a high complexity and implementations of these algorithms suffer from a heavy computational burden.\n\nThe Viterbi Algorithm tries to relax these conditions by applying a dynamic programming approach to the trellis structure [3]. In this approach only the strongest path survives to reduce the overhead generated by analyzing all possible paths through the trellis. Still the computational effort is very high.\n\nUp until now the technology used in SDRs has not been able to handle the computational burden of these algorithms. Implementations generally have suffered from a low throughput that was not suitable for state of the art communication systems (i.e. 3GPPP LTE or WLAN). Therefor these systems still used fixed hardware chips, such as ASICs, to manage the high throughput that these systems require.\n\nWith the increasing clock rates of General Purpose Processors (GPP) and the higher density of units inside the architecture, implementing these algorithms is starting to become more feasible. Especially additional architectural features such as SIMD architectures and multiple processor cores on one chip have gained increasing importance when implementing digital signal processing algorithms in software [4].\n\nAnother interesting field is the use of coprocessors found in common computers. In most cases this is going to be a GPU. GPU vendors also provide libraries and software development kits (SDK) to use the GPU for general computations and signal processing [5]. This specialized processors and libraries can be efficiently used to accelerate algorithms that can be massively parallelized.\n\nThis talk will cover implementation constraints that occur when implementing FEC and DSP algorithms on SIMD processors and GPUs. It will highlight some of the tripping hazard that newcomers have to avoid when trying to make an efficient use of these coprocessors. Exemplary cases for both architectures are analyzed to show, how the proper use of these architectures enhances a software defined communication system.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.

Some industrial users have reported working OAI-based systems integrated with commercially-deployable remote radio-head equipment and have provided demonstrations at major industrial tradeshows (Mobile World Congress Asia 2014, Mobile World Congress Barcelona in 2013, IMIC 2013). The current major industrial users of OpenAirInterface for collaborative projects are Agilent, China Mobile, IBM, Alcatel-Lucent, Thales, National Instruments and Orange.  The primary future objective is to provide an open-source reference implementation which follows the 3GPP standardization process starting from Rel-13 and the evolutionary path towards 5G and that is freely-available for experimentation on commodity laboratory equipment.\n\nWe detail some of the inner workings of OAI, in particular SIMD optimizations for real-operation and efficient numerical simulation of radio systems as well as information regarding tools used in the development of the protocol stack. We also provide some use cases of OAI experimental research as well as some the methodologies used for proof-of-concept design (simulation, testing and deployment).\n\n<h2>A bit on the need for open-source tools for 5G cellular evolution</h2>\n\nOpen-source has made a very significant impact in the extremities of current networks, namely in the terminals due to the Android ecosystem and in cloud infrastructure due, in part, to the OpenStack ecosystem.  The OpenAirInterface Software Foundation aims to provide a similar ecosystem for the core (EPC) and access-network (EUTRAN) of 3GPP cellular systems with the possibility of interoperating with closed-source equipment in either portion of the network. In addition to the huge economic success of the open-source model, the Foundation will be a tremendous tool used by both industry and academia. More importantly it will ensure a much-needed communication mechanism between the two in order to bring academia closer to complex real-world systems which are controlled by major industrial players in the wireless industry.  In the context of the evolutionary path towards 5G, there is clearly the need for open-source tools to ensure a common R&amp;D and prototyping framework for rapid proof-of-concept designs.\n\n<h2>About the Foundation</h2>\n\nThe Foundation is a non-profit organization (\"Fonds de Dotation\") founded by EURECOM, a world-renowned research institute in telecommunications and creator of OAI. EURECOM has been encouraged by the European Commission to extend OpenAirInterface to help in the definition of 5G systems. To this end, the Foundation will help drive innovation in 5G by following the standard as it is being drafted and, through quick interaction with 3GPP, will leverage the crowdsourcing effect both from industrial and academic users.  It strives to make OpenAirInterface become the de facto  reference implementation for new 3GPP standards through its open-source policy starting from Release 13 LTE.  The resulting development can be used in  both publicly-funded collaborative projects as well as industry-driven initiatives aiming to demonstrate 5G features at the earliest possible stage. Moreover, the results can be replicated in several locations independently through the combination of open-source and commodity hardware.  This then becomes a truly distributed experimental facility with a very large number of potential contributors.","start_time":"2015-01-31T13:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T13:30:00.000Z","track":"Software defined radio","location":"AW1.125","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/oai/"},

{"title":"Using the Linux IIO framework for SDR","subtitle":"A hardware abstraction layer","speakers":["Lars-Peter Clausen"],"description":"The Linux kernel Industrial IO (IIO) framework is responsible for handling sensors or converters of all kinds and variations. The framework acts as a hardware abstraction layer where kernel device drivers handle the low-level details of communicating with the hardware. A standard API is exposed from kernel- to userspace and generic requests made by userspace applications are translated into hardware specific requests by the framework and drivers. Having a standard API makes it possible for applications to discover the features of the connected hardware at runtime and to be written in a device independent way, which can greatly improves code re-usability.\n\nThis presentation will discuss the IIO framework in the context of Software-Defined-Radio and how it can be used as a generic and efficient transport of data to and from the hardware. It will start with a basic introduction to the IIO framework itself and than go on to discuss the SDR related bits in more detail. The presentation will cover the low-level bits and ideas of the API, the existing userspace applications and libraries up to the GNU Radio integration.\n\nThe presentation will conclude with a live demonstration that shows how the IIO framework can be used to efficiently stream data from a embedded FPGA SDR receiver board to GNU Radio running on a laptop for further processing.\n\nThe intention of the presentation is to make more people in the SDR community familiar with and knowledge about the IIO API in the hopes of further establishing IIO as a standard tool that can be used to separate hardware access from data processing. This should aid in being able to create generic hardware independent software.","start_time":"2015-01-31T14:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T14:30:00.000Z","track":"Software defined radio","location":"AW1.125","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/iiosdr/"},

To accomplish this, we need to know who the users are, what they think, do and want to achieve with our tool.\n\nIn Free Software projects this kind of work often is especially difficult. Our work can be distributed freely, so we do not know who or even how many people are using our product. And we usually do not have enough money to do market or customer research to fill this gaps. Finally, developers have become good to ward off anything that doesn't scratch their own itches. And without real user data, we often lack \"objective\" arguments to win developers to implement changes needed.\n\nWith this talk, I want to reflect on my experiences with user research and user driven design in different FLOSS projects, esp. KDE and LibreOffice. Based on this, I will present an idea, how tooling could possibly improve the situation.

Users arrive and things break, features that seem basic are missing, and the channels through which they might ask for help are hard to find or non-existent. They're wondering, \"Who did you build this for? Why is it so annoying to use?\" Meanwhile, developers put their time and energy into building technology to free their users and are left wondering, \"Why aren't people just using this? It's not <em>really</em> that hard to figure out.\"\n\nTwo free software activists, one developer and one community liaison, take turns asking each other questions about their experiences and goals. All the questions about intent and process that you've been wondering about will finally be answered. At MediaGoblin, we've worked hard to keep the lines of communication between developers and users open from the beginning. This public conversation between MediaGoblin's technical founder and community liaison will replicate some of those conversations for the audience.

Disabilities include blindness or visual impairment, deaf or hard of hearing, people with motor impairments, people with dyslexia, and others. For years, there have been assistive technologies such as screen readers for the blind, magnifiers for visually impaired, subtitles or sign language captionings for videos, switches or other assistive devices for people with motor impairments, and many more to help those 20 % come onto the web and participate just as their non-disabled friends and family members do.\n\nIn addition, the demographic development suggests that by the year 2030, half the population in Europe, the U.S. and Canada will be age 60 and older. Those commonly called \"silver surfers\" will also benefit from bigger touch targets, better contrast and other usability techniques traditionally associated with accessibility, even when they do not have any disability themselves at all.\n\nAs mobile devices spread throughout the world, and Firefox OS sets new standards in affordability and availability in many countries that did not have access to smartphones before, it is more and more important that web applications offered on those devices are usable by the broadest range of users possible.\n\nThis presentation aims to provide some basic easy checks and testing techniques to help you as a developer of a mobile web application to apply good programming practices so your app can reach more users than you ever thought possible. Marco will show how you can use a Firefox OS device and Firefox itself to do these easy checks and take good techniques home to put to use straight away.","start_time":"2015-01-31T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T11:25:00.000Z","track":"Mozilla","location":"UD2.218A","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/reaching_more_users_through_better_accessibility/"},

{"title":"The FLK project","subtitle":"Security by the language, no MMU, no processes","speakers":["José Bollo"],"description":"The common state of the art is focused on POSIX implementation: C programming, processes, threads, mutexes, etc... But this has some issues: one stack per thread with strong separation of processes made by the use of MMU.\n\nBy changing the language, this concepts are becoming obsoletes and the issues disappearing. But the security remains and even more is enforceable at an API level.\n\nSCOOP, the Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming, is expressing the concurrency inside the language (without need of IPC or IDL) by linking (sub)systems to abstract processors.\n\nEach of the SCOOP abstract processor has its own isolated memory. The FLK (http://flhq.org) implementation ensures the isolation of the memory at the language level. This done, no MMU is no more needed. Yes, the memory is managed by the kernel, but using only one common addressing space, a flat model.\n\nSCOOP provides the model of synchronizing multiple resources. This synchronisation is native and is made using Rhee's algorithm that can be distributed. Having this avoid any need of mutexes, semaphores.\n\nConversely, this model tends to multiply the count of abstract processor in a way that can not be implemented using threads because of their weight. But it allows to change the underlying mechanism. Abstract processors are not executed within a private context/stack but on the current execution context that crosses processors.\n\nNew security behaviours tends to include security at the API level. The coupling of the compiler with the kernel allow to enforce this behaviour at compile time, installation time and (if very paranoiac) at runtime.","start_time":"2015-01-31T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T10:30:00.000Z","track":"Microkernels","location":"K.3.201","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/flk/"},

Once this is cleared up, it becomes way easier to know where to contribute fixes and features!\n\nThis talk will thus take a few examples of typical application operations (opening and reading a file, opening and working with a socket) and go through the RPC path, to illustrate how translators are involved and where the eventual implementations actually reside.\n\nIt will also be an opportunity to give the latest news about the GNU/Hurd project.","start_time":"2015-01-31T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T11:00:00.000Z","track":"Microkernels","location":"K.3.201","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/hurd/"},

{"title":"Introducing a radically componentized GUI architecture","subtitle":"","speakers":["Norman Feske"],"description":"GUIs face the challenge to appeal to users with vastly different tastes. Visually, each user seems to have different preferences, which current-generation GUIs try to address with theming engines. But also conceptually, different groups of users prefer different concepts. For example, a window manager might support floating windows, tiled windows, tabbed windows, and virtual desktops. In order to be appealing to a large user base, it has to support as many of those concepts as possible. As another example, modern widget tool kits such as Qt5 try to accommodate all kinds of applications with a huge library of features. The richness of features, however, comes at a price, which is the overwhelming complexity of current-generation GUI systems. Large parts of the GUI are shared among graphical applications including both privacy-sensitive as well as potentially malicious programs. In the presence of malware, the complexity becomes a large attack surface. But how can this be avoided?\n\nThe talk will introduce a new architecture that applies microkernel construction principles to split the GUI into an arrangement of components such that the highly complex elements are stuffed away in sand boxes where they cannot do any harm. The security-critical parts are encapsulated into tiny components that do not even rely on a C runtime. Their ultra-low complexity and rigid interfaces mitigate the chance for attacks. At the same time, the architecture provides large degrees of freedom with respect to the virtual presentation and the window-layout management.\n\nThe key components and their relationship will be explained and demonstrated live during the talk.","start_time":"2015-01-31T14:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T14:45:00.000Z","track":"Microkernels","location":"K.3.201","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/genode/"},

{"title":"Finding Bad Needles in Worldwide Haystacks","subtitle":"Experience of using Go for a large-scale web security scanner","speakers":["Dmitry Savintsev"],"description":"Go has caught our attention after the 1.0 release  with the approachable learning curve, clean syntax, good HTTP library and built-in concurrency/syncronization primitives and overall a promise of a good match for our tasks. As a warm-up and initial study, we wrote a dead link scanner to plow through thousands of sites and find a number of \"bad needles\" (404s) - all while running on a single server.  Encouraged, we proceeded with converting several parts of the security scanning system to Go.\n\nWe started with \"webseclab\" - set of tests for the scanner and framework to do experiments and proof of concepts/demos. It is similar in spirit to the recently released \"firing range\", webgoat or DVWA (\"Damn Vulnerable Web Application\") but thanks to the Go implementation may have special or even unique features.It is extremely easy to fire up (no dependencies and no Tomcat setup or such needed) which allows you to turn any random VM or host into a functional web security \"lab\". Also, switching between Go's text and html templates, we get \"for free\" - with just a few lines of extra code - a set of \"fixed\" tests where the injections are neutralized by proper output escaping which comes especially useful for training and communicating with developers.  The webseclab is optimized for rapid addition of new tests and cases - we have been using it to \"resurrect\" already fixed issues reported through the BugBounty program and quickly convert HTTP dumps into realistic tests ready to be used for scanner improvement.\n\nThe next stage of the still ongoing conversion was rewrite of the analysis engine.  We named it \"contextdetect\" as the task of defining the HTML context is crucial for that piece, and here Go has helped us to a break-through.  Gone are painful and fragile layers of regexps and scripting logic that were used to simulate HTML parsing and context detection - but still lead to bouts of either false positives or false negatives.  We use net/html HTML5 parser [1] to define the HTML context where the injection happens and evaluate it accordingly.  We also use Robert Krimen's Javascript parser \"otto\" [1] to check whether an injection breaks the Javascript (likely bad) or not.  Using real parsers allowed us to reduce the number of annoying false positives close to zero and make the life of the tool's users more pleasant - while still finding the real issues (as continously verified with the webseclab).  We also implemented in Go a web services wrapper that distributes the work to a number of redundant scanning workers and used \"go test\" for functional smoke test of the scanner.\n\nIn the process of development in our CD environment, we had several challenges with the build process as the standard \"go get\" approach was off-limits for us and we have a strict requirement to mirror all the 3rd party code used for builds internally.  Currently we are using the Android REPO tool to maintain description of the dependencies as well as specify the GOPATH-compatible workspace - we will discuss our considerations of the involved tradeoffs.\n\nWhile not everyone may have to be as obsessed with defending against XSS and other badness as we are, we hope that our experience will be helpful and encouraging for others who need to do large-scale web or network verification, quality assurance, or investigations.  Let's go make the web a better and safer place! :)\n\n[1] https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/html\n[2] https://godoc.org/github.com/robertkrimen/otto","start_time":"2015-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2015-01-31T08:45:00.000Z","track":"Go","location":"K.3.401","links":[""],"url":"https:/fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/go_web_security_scanner/"},

All virtual addresses are accessed via a memory capability, an unforgeable token of authority that can be stored in registers or memory and grants rights to a region of memory.

{"title":"Code clone detection in LLVM compiler infrastructure","subtitle":"LLVM: built-in scalable code clone detection based on semantic analysis","speakers":["Sevak Sargsyan"],"description":"Two code fragments are called clones if they are identical by some similarity function. Code clones detection has number of applications. It can be used for semantic mistakes detection, automatic refactoring, code quality improvements and optimizations. There are several methods for code clones detection. Textual [1] and lexical [2] approaches are not capable to detect all clone types [3]. The Algorithms based on abstract syntax tree [4] and metrics [5] have low accuracy. The algorithms based on program dependence graph (PDG) [6] allow reaching high accuracy. But these algorithms have large computational complexity, which makes them unusable for real world projects analysis.\nThis paper describes scalable and accurate method of code clones detection, which allow analyze million lines of source code (written in C/C++). As well it describes architecture of the tool based on this method. The tool has two basic parts. The first part is designed as LLVM pass [7] and responsible for PDGs generation. The second part designed as LLVM tool [7], which analyzes PDGs to detect clones.\nThe method based on PDG and has some extra features, which makes it capable for large scale projects analysis. Dependence graphs are constructed at compile-time based on intermediate representation (bitcode) of LLVM [7] (first part). This approach has number of advantages compared with analogical methods [8]. Source code parses only once (during compilation). No need for extra analysis of dependencies between compilation modules. When all graphs are generated second part of tool split them to subgraphs. Then clone detection algorithm runs for pair of these subgraphs. Therefore it is important to split graphs so that every possible clone was located inside one subgraph. Existed methods split PDG to weakly connected components. Some of them split to subgraphs, which are intersected with each other in limited number of vertices [9]. Two algorithms were designed for graphs’ partitioning. Theses improve the number of detected clones. The first method divides PDG to relatively equal pieces. Second one splits PDG to subgraphs, where corresponding source code has sequential order. <br/>\n Scalability was achieved by composition of two types of algorithms. The first type of algorithms tries to prove if two graphs do not have enough large isomorphic subgraphs. These algorithms have liner complexity. Up to 80% of PDGs are processed by them [9]. Other 20% are analyzed with approximate algorithms of maximal isomorphic subgraphs detection. They have high accuracy and computational complexity.\nTarget machine of testing was Intel Core i3 CPU 540 with 8 GB RAM. Mozilla Firefox (3.8 million lines of С/С++ code) – was analyzed in 8h, detected 98 clones, 7 of them were false positive (manual analysis). LLVM+CLANG (1.3 million lines of С/С++ code) – was analyzed in 6h, detected 51 clones, 2 of them were false. OpenSSL (280 000 lines of С/С++ code) – was analyzed in ~200 second, 107 clones are detected.\n\nReferences\n1.Ducasse S.

Two layers of sandboxing, a static verification inner sandbox combined with Chrome’s outer process sandbox, ensure users can safely run untrusted applications. Portable Native Client builds on this foundation by providing a portable LLVM IR derived wire format which is seamlessly compiled and run on the fly. Support for venerable, cornerstone POSIX APIs—files, processes, sockets, terminal I/O— is then built on top of an I/O layer called PPAPI with security limitations that mirror the constraints of Javascript.\n\nCome learn about: porting Clang/LLVM to Native Client, bridging the gap between POSIX and the Web, measuring performance, and connecting Clang/LLVM with other FOSS tools in our in-browser development environment, including editors, interpreters, and build tools.
